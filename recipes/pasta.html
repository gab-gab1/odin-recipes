        <h3>My everyday Bolognese recipe I make over and over again</h3>
        <p><em>This Meat Sauce has terrific depth of flavour for such a quick recipe – though if you have the time, it's stellar cooked slowly for a couple of hours.<br>My 3 "secret" tips are: Worcestershire Sauce, Beef Bouillon Cubes and a touch of sugar. </em></p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves , minced</li>
            <li>1 onion , finely chopped (brown, yellow or white)</li>
            <li>1 lb / 500g beef mince (ground beef)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (125 ml) dry red wine</li>
            <li>2 beef bouillon cubes , crumbled OR granulated beef bouillon</li>
            <li>800g / 28 oz can crushed tomato</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tsp white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp cooking salt (kosher salt)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
         </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>

         <ol>
            <li>Sauté – Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.</li>
            <li>Cook beef – Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
            <li>Reduce wine – Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.</li>
            <li>Simmer – Add the remaining ingredients. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 – 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>Slow simmer option: really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 – 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce.</li>
            <li>Taste and add more salt it desired. Serve over spaghetti – though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta</li>
         </ol>

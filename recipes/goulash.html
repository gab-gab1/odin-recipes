        <h3>The national dish of Hungary!</h3>         
            <p><em>Boldly flavoured with stacks of paprika, lots of onion, garlic and capsicum/bell peppers,
            with fall apart hunks of beef.It's sort of a stew, sort of a soup.<br> The broth is not supposed to be as thick as typical stews. 
            It's naturally thickened slightly using fresh tomatoes that break down into the sauce.</em></p>

            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 litre / 4 cups beef stock/broth</li>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan), though you can use your slow cooker or stove instead</li>
            <li>Season beef – Toss the beef with half the salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook onion – Heat the oil and melt the butter in a large oven-proof dutch oven over high heat. Cook onion for 6 minutes until the edges are light golden.</li>
            <li>Cook beef – Add the beef and stir until the outside changes from red to brown, about 2 minutes. It won't go golden brown, it's not supposed to.</li>
            <li>Add vegetables – Add garlic, capsicum and tomato. Stir for 3 minutes – the tomato will mostly breakdown</li>
            <li>Add paprika, caraway and bay leaf. Stir for 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Slow cook – Add beef stock, stir, bring to simmer. Cover with a lid and transfer to the oven for 1 1/2 hours</li>
            <li>Add potato – The beef should be pretty tender but not quite "fall-apart". Stir in carrot and potatoes. Return to oven, covered, for another 30 minutes. Beef should now be "fall-apart" – if not, return to the oven for 10 minutes at a time</li>
            <li>Serve – Ladle goulash into bowls and sprinkle with parsley. Eat as is, with optional bread for dunking!</li>
        </ol>
